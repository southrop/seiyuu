# Seiyuu Nickname Bot

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/southrop/seiyuu.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/southrop/seiyuu)

A simple Twitter bot that lives at [@seiyu_nickname](https://twitter.com/seiyu_nickname). It replies with the full name or nickname(s) of a [seiyuu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_acting_in_Japan), depending on what you tweet at it. It does not make any tweets of its own.

This bot takes heavy inspiration from the [NYPL Emoji Bot](https://github.com/lolibrarian/NYPL-Emoji-Bot).
